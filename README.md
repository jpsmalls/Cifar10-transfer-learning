# CIFAR-10 Transfer Learning with VGG16

This project demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using transfer learning with the pre-trained VGG16 model. The implementation is done in Google Colab and includes data preprocessing, model adaptation, training, evaluation, and result visualization using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Installation

To run this project in Google Colab, you don't need to install anything locally. All necessary packages are available in the Colab environment.

## Project Details

The project consists of the following steps:
1. **Setup and Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. **Load and Adapt Pre-trained Model**: Use the VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet and adapt it for CIFAR-10 classification.
3. **Train the Model**: Train the adapted model using the training data.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
5. **Visualize Results**: Plot training and validation accuracy and loss.
